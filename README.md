# MCBOT
MCBOT is a nickname for a Minecraft: Java Edition bot I am making using mineflayer.

Installation: I am a MacOS user, so the installdependencies.sh file is an executable bash file that updates homebrew (google how to install it if you don't know how), then installs the dependencies for this bot to work. Once you are in the directory with the bot.js, do the following (text in square brackets in the command are placeholders). node bot.js [Server IP] [Server Port] [Account Email] [Account Password] 

Currently this only works with Mojang accounts, but this will be changed very soon (VERY VERY (well as soon as I have time)).
